# face_behavior_trait_inferences
Four studies exploring the contribution of facial information vs. behavioral
information to trait inference


Studies 1 and 2 explore facial/behavioral trustworthiness and dominance in
White male targets

Study 3 explores facial/behavioral dominance in White female targets

Study 4 explores facial/behavioral trustworthiness in Black male targets

The stimuli and dimensions for studies 3 and 4 were predicated on steretypes
of the target demographics (e.g., 'warm/wonderful woman', 'threatening black male')

The difference in data files is due to data collection modalities
The first two studies underwent data collection in fall 2018 and spring 2019, 
in-person via psychopy

The last two were collected in fall 2020 and spring 2021 online via qualtrics
